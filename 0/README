The merge sort used to sort the doubly linked list is adapted from notes taken from
comp sci 201 lecture in fall 2017.

This assignment, besides the actual construction of a heap mananger, is
extremely unclear in what you want to optimize. All optimizations come at a cost,
so it's very easy to get lost in trying to minimize your manager's stack footprint
or the memeory accuracy, or the runtime efficiency of malloc, or the runtime efficiency
of free, or trying to manage complexity of the environemnt from anothers perspective.

THESE OPTIMIZATIONS ARE OFTEN CONFLICTING IN NATURE<AND SO THE LACK OF CLARITY ON
EXACTLY WHAT ONE SHOULD BE TRYING TO OPTIMIZE IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO SPEND
DAYS ON AN EFFICIENT STACK SIZE IMPLEMENTATION ONLY TO REALIZE THAT THE GRADER
SYSTEM CARES NOT FOR IT AND INSTEAD WANTS TO FOCUS ON OTHER "UNAMED EFFICIENIES"
and having to SCRAP that work because you were optimizing for the wrong this.

CLARITY!
